# Module-4-Challenge

## Description

Web APIs Challenge, or Module 4's Challenge, is to build a timed coding (Javascrit) quiz with multiple-choice questions for students to gauge their progress against their peers. This app will run in the browser and will feature HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. The task will be achieved when a student is able to begin the quiz by clicking a start button, be presented with several multiple-choice questions and have the ability to answer thoses questions (minus 15 seconds if wrong), and save their high score locally when the game is over (i.e., when all questions are answered or clock hits 0). This challenge will test our ability to understand Javascript and utilize functions, arrays, for loops, time intervals, get elements, variables, if/else functions and references.
